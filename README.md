# CLI-BluRay-Database
A command line interface BluRay database, use numbers to navigate the menus and store information about different movies.

****************************** Known bugs ******************************

If you enter a number larger than 4 on the Blu-Ray Directory, it will return to the homepage instead of the directory, I think this is due to having true as a while loop condition.

Sometimes the program gets stuck in a loop and I am not sure of the cause. When trying to cause the bug to happen again the same steps always end up in the program working fine.
